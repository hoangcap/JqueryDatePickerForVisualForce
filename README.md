# JqueryDatePickerForVisualForce
I created this component due to I saw the problem of salesforce standard datepicker(include html &lt;apex:input> that need support html5).

Installation url:https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t1000000035ab (Unmanaged Package)
Change login.salesforce.com to test.salesforce.com when you want to install at Sandbox.
